How to run from a shell window:

Open console (terminal, command.exe, whatever)

Navigate to inside Minor Release 2.0 folder

Compile the code:

javac *.java

Run the code:

java Play

Don't forget, if you edit the code then recompile it before running.

->  (directly executing the jar file will run half only as it cannot accessed images folder but when compiled using a terminal it works fine).
